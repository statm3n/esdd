Description: An implementation of consensus docking methods for early-stage drug discovery in R. It consists of
          of two discrete mixture models: Multivariate Mixture Model(MMM) and Mean-Variance Mixture Model(MVM);
          one continuous mixture model and R-value ranking scheme: Uniform-Pareto Mixture (UPM). Two standard performence
          evaluation metrics, i.e., ROCAUC and Enrichment Factor, are provided as well. See Henderson and Newton (2016),
          Ericksen et al. (2017) and Rpackage rvalue for more details.
